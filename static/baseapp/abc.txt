Configuring static files¶

Make sure that django.contrib.staticfiles is included in your INSTALLED_APPS.

In your settings file, define STATIC_URL, for example:

STATIC_URL = "static/"
In your templates, use the static template tag to build the URL for the given relative path using the configured staticfiles STORAGES alias.

{% load static %}
<img src="{% static 'my_app/example.jpg' %}" alt="My image">
Store your static files in a folder called static in your app. For example my_app/static/my_app/example.jpg.

Serving the files

In addition to these configuration steps, you’ll also need to actually serve the static files.

During development, if you use django.contrib.staticfiles, this will be done automatically by runserver when DEBUG is set to True (see django.contrib.staticfiles.views.serve()).

This method is grossly inefficient and probably insecure, so it is unsuitable for production.
